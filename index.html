        <h2> Photography</h2>
        <p> Here, you'll find a curated collection of my favorite landscape and cityscape images. Each photo captures the essence of my travels and the beauty I see in everyday life.  </p>
        <p>Iâ€™m not a professional, but I enjoy capturing the moments that catch my eye. Thanks for checking out my gallery! I hope you like these pictures as much as I enjoyed taking them.</p>
        <p>I use my smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra) to take these photos and I use Adobe Lightroom to edit these pictures. I am still learning a lot about Photography and Photo editing</p>
